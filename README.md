# Log_in_Authenticattion
This project is a full-stack application built with Node.js and React to provide user login authentication using cookies. It ensures secure user sessions by storing authentication tokens in HTTP-only cookies, protecting against XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks. The application supports user login, logout, and session verification.
